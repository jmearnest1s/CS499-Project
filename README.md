# CS499-Project
Description 
Welcome to our project! This is a run down on our code (PHP framwork) and file navigation to help anyone who wishes to run and understand our project. 
We are working on the agWiki site to implement a report post and hide post functionality. These functions allow user-to-user moderation and will allow this site to be listed on the Apple App store or the Google play store. The following files are already implemented: 

Admin: 
Includes files: css, fonts, img, and js 
css: sweetalert.css, login.min.css, layout.min.css, datatables.min.css, darkblue.min.css
fonts: FontAwesome.otf, fontawesome-webfont.eot, fontawesome-webfont.ttf, fontawesome-webfont.woff2
img: sidebar_toggler_icon_darkblue.png
js: app.min.js, bootstrap-modal.js, bootstrao.min.js, datatable.js, jquery.validate.min.js

agwiki-blayzer: 
includes files: agwiki-blayzer/core/, assets/font/css, core/resources/views
agwiki-blayzer/core/: auth.blade.php, dash.blade.php
assets/font/css: dev.css
core/resources/views: single-post.blade/php

css: 
Includes files: admin, app, routes, storage, tests 

The major changes were made to the Models file within the app directory and changes to the web.php file within the app/routes directory, there is still some more changes that need to be done and we are currently working on making those changes for the future.

The current application is not functioning as we have not been able to work on the projecect as much as we would have liked due to a delayed start on the project and trying to learn the languange and navigate the already created agwiki directories.

If viewers would like to add on or contribute to this project you would be adding your work in the agwiki-blayzer/core/ files.
