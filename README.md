# CS499-Project
Description 
Welcome to our project! This is a run down on our code (PHP framwork) and file navigation to help anyone who wishes to run and understand our project. 
We are working on the agWiki site to implement a report post and hide post functionality. These functions allow user-to-user moderation and will allow this site to be listed on the Apple App store or the Google play store. The following files are already implemented: 

Admin: 
Includes files: css, fonts, img, and js 
css: sweetalert.css, login.min.css, layout.min.css, datatables.min.css, darkblue.min.css
fonts: FontAwesome.otf, fontawesome-webfont.eot, fontawesome-webfont.ttf, fontawesome-webfont.woff2
img: sidebar_toggler_icon_darkblue.png
js: app.min.js, bootstrap-modal.js, bootstrao.min.js, datatable.js, jquery.validate.min.js

agwiki-blayzer: 
includes files: agwiki-blayzer/core/, assets/font/css, core/resources/views
agwiki-blayzer/core/: auth.blade.php, dash.blade.php
assets/font/css: dev.css
core/resources/views: single-post.blade/php

css: 
Includes files: admin, app, routes, storage, tests 

If viewers would like to add on or contribute to this project you would be adding your work in the agwiki-blayzer/core/ files.
